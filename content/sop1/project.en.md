title: "Project"
---

The project lasts four weeks, from 25.11 to 22.12. During W3 (23.12), checking and evaluation will take place in accordance with the details described in the content.

The source code for evaluation should be send to the server, as during the laboratory - the path to the project is `p1en`. Please note some technical limitations:
- Unfortunately, the server is online only twice a week - on Mondays from 8:15 to 23:00 and on Tuesdays from 14:15 to 17:00. Only then is it possible to push your solution
- The server is only accessible from the faculty network. To push your solution from outside of the network, you can use two options:
  - copy it to the ssh server (scp to `ssh.mini.pw.edu.pl`) and push it from there as during the lab
  - use ssh tunneling (note - you will also need to change/add `remote` in the repository)

The server performs a preliminary check, similar to the laboratory, and in case of an error, it may reject the solution. However, since the project requires writing more code than in a regular lab, the rules are a bit more relaxed. It is acceptable (and recommended) to create and modify new .c and .h files. Only the initial `Makefile` and `.clang-format` cannot be modified. As always, source files should be formatted and the program should compile without any errors or warnings.
