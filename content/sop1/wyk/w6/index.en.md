# Threads, P-threads and mutexes

## Scope

  - Thread concept. Single- and multiple-thread processes.
  - Advantages of multi-threading. Scaling and Amdahl's law.
  - Multicore programming issues.
  - User and kernel threads
  - Multithreading models. Co-routines; fibers.
  - Thread libraries: POSIX threads, Windows threads
  - Implicit threading. Thread pools. OpenMP
  - Threading issues:fork/exec, signal handling, cancellation, thread-local storage, scheduler activations
  - POSIX threads API:
      - thread creation (`pthread_create()`) and ending (`pthread_exit(), exit(), pthread_cancel()`, returning from/exiting `main()` function)
      - thread attributes
      - passing parameters to thread function; returning result
      - waiting for joinable thread (`pthread_join()`), detaching thread (`pthread_detach`)
      - synchronization: motivation, using `mutex` to protect critical section related to some shared, concurrently accessed data
      - re-entrant and thread safe functions
      - threads and signals: thread signal masks and their use
