## Scope
  
### Basic content

  - Independent vs cooperating processes. Reasons for cooperation.
  - Two fundamental models of interprocess communication (IPC): shared memory, message passing.
  - Main features of shared memory based IPC.
  - Main features of message passing based IPC.
  - POSIX pipes/FIFOs
      - POSIX definition and semantics of pipes/FIFOs. Creation/destruction, file-like access without positioning capability, consequences of bounded buffering, blocking/non-blocking access.
      - (anonymous) pipes - creation: `pipe()`, destruction: `close()` of all references. Pipe and `fork()` - opportunities. Example uses. Shortcut: `popen()`, `pclose()`
      - FIFOs ("named pipes") - creation: `mkpipe()`, desctruction: `unlink()` vs `close()` of all open descriptors related to FIFO.
      - Error condition notifications: `SIGPIPE` signal, `errno` values: `EPIPE`, `ESPIPE`.
      - Blocking mode FIFO access and possible deadlock.

### Auxiliary content

  - Non-blocking use of FIFOs: pros and cons.
  - Pipes in non-Posix systems (notably MS Win).
